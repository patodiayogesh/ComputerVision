In this assignment weâ€™ll build a simple convolutional neural network
in PyTorch and Train it to recognize natural objects using the CIFAR-10 dataset.
We observe the difference between training from scratch and fine-tuning a
pre-trained model

We also perform experiment to understand how a deep NN works.
The deep learning is quite powerful and can achieve great performance after training for a few epochs.
However, we still don't know why it works.
Thus, we first study activation map to analysis the region that triggers the final classification.
Then, we visualize a few kernels to infer what is learned in the neural network.
The results and inference can be viewd in the notebook.
